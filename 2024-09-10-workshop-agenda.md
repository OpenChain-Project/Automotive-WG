### Proposed Talks or Deep-Dives

	- How AI BOM process management has been discussed in 2024 and what that means for the automotive industry
5. **Software Defined Vehicle / Eclipse SDV [1]**

6. **Catena-X [2] / Eclipse Tractus-X [3]**
	- 'Are there potential synergies with the OpenChain community and is there also a supply chain for data?' by Lars Geyer-Blaumeise, Cofinity-X
7. **COVESA [4]**
