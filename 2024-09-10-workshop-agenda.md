### Other Proposed Talks or Deep-Dives Pending Speakers:

	- How will a future software supply chain will look like and what needs to be expected with OTA-updates in the vehicles?
4. **[COVESA](https://covesa.global/)**
	- What needs to be considered in the automotive software supply chain when vehicles will become more and more connected?
