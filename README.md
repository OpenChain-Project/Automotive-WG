# Welcome to the OpenChain Automotive Work Group

## The OpenChain Project has been building trust in the supply chain Since 2016

Our vision is a supply chain where open source is delivered with trusted and consistent process management information. Our mission is to make that happen. The OpenChain Project has an extensive global community of over 1,000 companies collaborating to make the supply chain quicker, more effective and more efficient. We work with our sister projects at The Linux Foundation like SPDX (SBOM), OpenSSF (Security), TODO Group (OSPO) and CHAOSS (Metrics) to help drive forward business management of open source.

## We Maintain Standards

 - OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230
 -- The international standard for open source license compliance programs
 - OpenChain ISO/IEC 18974
 -- The industry standard for open source security assurance programs
